<p>
First and foremost, to lay the foundation of my application, I created an ERD, or an Entity Relationship Diagram to show links between the entities or objects created and the relationship between them, then went on to create the schema. I created two main objects, the projects object and timesheet object, then went on to create a report that would sum the hours worked on a given project! 
<br/>
-------------------------------------------------------------
<br/>
An ERD is a logical, visual diagram of entities, such as people, things or objects, and how they relate to each other within a database or system. A data schema is a relational model or diagram as well, however it is used as a blueprint to build a database and show how data will be stored in a database, whether that database is relational or non-relational. An entity relationship diagram is essential because they ultimately tell a story about an entity and can show the various effects on different structures within an entity, and data schemas are just as essential to group logical entities, protect objects, etc.
